Programming Practice 3.2  numToText

Clone this file and open it in IntelliJ.

You will only need to work in the src file numToText. Method changeNumToText() needs to be completed. Write sufficient code so that
when a single digit is read in, the English word for that digit is returned.

Do NOT change any existing code.  You only need to write the logical structures within that method.

To turn in, show me on your laptop the results when you run numToTextTest().
